including associated software components, media, graphics, web pages, printed

PRODUCT on as many computers as necessary to serve the internal needs of your
enterprise, in accordance with your Use as set forth in the next paragraph.

<li>Use. Edustructures grants you the right to use the PRODUCT for developing, 
testing and deploying software agents complying with the SIF (Schools Interoperability
Framework) specification for SIF Agents. No additional use is allowed unless
explicitly granted herein.

<li>Redistribution. Certain files contained in this PRODUCT are marked in the
PRODUCT Help files or other documentation as &quot;REDISTRIBUTABLE FILES.&quot; You may
distribute freely and without royalties REDISTRIBUTABLE FILES as part of any
software you develop using some or all of the code in the PRODUCT.

<li>Source Code. Certain files contained in this PRODUCT are delivered to you in
SOURCE CODE form; that is, they are delivered to you in a human readable format
which must be run through a compiler to create machine-executable code (&quot;OBJECT
CODE&quot;). With regard only to those files actually delivered to you by
Edustructures in SOURCE CODE form, you are licensed to modify the files and use
your modifications in developing, testing and deplying SIF software. You are
also licensed to use the files in the unmodified form. If a file delivered to
you as SOURCE CODE is also marked as a REDISTRIBUTABLE FILE, you may
redistribute either the modified or unmodified form, but only as OBJECT CODE.
Under no circumstances may you disclose or distribute any SOURCE CODE to third
parties without express, separate, written permission of Edustructures.

<li>Backup Copies. You may also make copies of the PRODUCT as may be necessary for
backup and archival purposes.</p>

held by Edustructures and its suppliers.

interpreted to impair your rights to distribute your own code (including any

written consent of Edustructures.

<li>Compliance with Applicable Laws. You must comply with all applicable laws

documentation created by Edustructures and provided with the PRODUCT. When
informed of a difference between the PRODUCT operation and the documentation,
Edustructures will use commercially reasonable best efforts to correct such
difference. EXCEPT AS SET FORTH HEREIN, THE PRODUCT AND ANY RELATED
DOCUMENTATION IS PROVIDED &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,  WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR  A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NONINFRINGEMENT.</p>

<p>6. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law,
in no event shall Edustructures or its suppliers be liable for any special,
incidental, indirect, or consequential damages whatsoever (including, without
limitation, damages for loss of business profits, business interruption, loss of
business information, or any other pecuniary loss) arising out of the use of or
inability to use the PRODUCT or the provision of or failure to provide Support
Services, even if Edustructures has been advised of the possibility of such
damages. In any case, Edustructures's entire liability under any provision of
this EULA shall be limited to the amount actually paid by you for the PRODUCT;
provided however, if you have entered into a Edustructures Support Services
Agreement, Edustructures's entire liability regarding Support Services shall be
governed by the terms of that agreement. Because some states and jurisdictions
