    <h1>
        SIFWorks ADK for .Net<br />
        ReadMe</h1>
    <p>
        This version of the ADK parially supports the SIF 1.1, 1.5r1 specifications and
        fully supports the SIF 2.0r1 and 2.1 specifications.
        Please consult the Release Overview for important information as this version of the
        ADK contains new functionality and some changes of which all developers should be
        aware.</p>
    <h2>
        ADK SIF Compliance Testing</h2>
    <h3>
        SIF Versions</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The compliance test harness doesn&#8217;t allow the agent to register with versions
            prior to <span class="caps">SIF 2</span>.0r1. Before you start testing, set a property
            to tell the <span class="caps">ADK</span> to register with a custom set of <span
                class="caps">SIF </span>Versions:<br />
            &lt;property name=&#8221;adk.provisioning.overrideSifVersions&#8221; value=&#8221;2.0r1,2.1,2.*&#8221;
            /&gt;<br />
        </li>
        <li>The <span class="caps">ADK SIF </span>Version should be set to the version the compliance
            test harness is testing. (E.g. &#8220;2.0r1&#8221; for the 2.0r1 test harness)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
        SSL settings</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Make sure your <span class="caps">CSQ</span> matches the <span class="caps">SSL</span>
            settings below</li>
        <li>Make sure your agent creates a certificate with a <span class="caps">DSA</span>
            key-pair. Most of our agents, by default, create one with an <span class="caps">RSA</span>
            key-pair. The test harness requires <span class="caps">DSA</span> in one of it&#8217;s
            tests because <span class="caps">DSA</span> is a required cipher for <span class="caps">
                TLS 1</span>.0. </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>
        Section 5: Implementation Dependent Behavior</h2>
    <p>
        Here is a preliminary set of claims that should be supported by all <span class="caps">
            ADK</span> agents.</p>
    <h3>
        Characterization of the product&#8217;s implementation-dependent behavior</h3>
    <h3>
        Transport Support</h3>
    <p>
        Check both <span class="caps">SIF HTTPS</span> and <span class="caps">SIF HTTP</span></p>
    <h3>
        Mode Support</h3>
    <p>
        Check both Push and Pull</p>
    <h3>
        HTTPS Support</h3>
    <p>
        -Which <span class="caps">SSL</span> versions does your application support for
        initiating connections to the <span class="caps">ZIS</span>?-</p>
    <p>
        Don&#8217;t Check: <span class="caps">TLS 1</span>.0 and <span class="caps">SSL 3</span>.0<br />
        Check: <span class="caps">TLS 1</span>.0 negotiated using an <span class="caps">SSL
            2</span>.0 helloSSL 3.0 negotiated using an <span class="caps">SSL 2</span>.0
        hello</p>
    <p>
        -If your application supports Push mode, which <span class="caps">SSL</span> versions
        can your agent accept when receiving incoming connections from the <span class="caps">
            ZIS</span>?-</p>
    <p>
        Check all four</p>
    <h3>
        Security</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>SIF Authentication Level Support</strong></p>
    <p>
        -Is your agent capable of returning client certificates (authentication level 1-3)?-</p>
    <p>
        Yes</p>
    <p>
        -If your agent ever explicitly requests authentication levels 1-3 of other agents
        at delivery time, which authentication levels might be explicitly requested?-</p>
    <p>
        1,2,3</p>
    <p>
        -If your agent authenticates server certificates returned by the <span class="caps">
            ZIS</span>, which authentication levels might be required?-</p>
    <p>
        1,2,3</p>
    <p>
        -If your agent supports Push mode and your agent ever requires a client certificate
        from the <span class="caps">ZIS</span>, which authentication levels might be required?-</p>
    <p>
        1,2,3</p>
    <h3>
        SIF Encryption Level Support</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>Encryption Level</strong></p>
    <p>
        -Which encryption levels is your agent capable of supporting in <span class="caps">SIF
            HTTPS</span>?-</p>
    <p>
        1,2,3,4 (don&#8217;t check 0)</p>
    <p>
        -If your agent ever explicitly requests encryption levels of other agents at delivery
        time, which encryption levels might be required?-</p>
    <p>
        1,2,3,4 (don&#8217;t check 0)</p>
    <p>
        -Which encryption levels might your agent require from a <span class="caps">ZIS</span>
        in <span class="caps">SIF HTTPS</span>?-</p>
    <p>
        1,2,3,4 (don&#8217;t check 0)</p>
    <h3>
        Message Validation</h3>
    <p>
        Is your application capable of performing <span class="caps">XML</span> validation
        on incoming messages?</p>
    <p>
        The
        <span class="caps">ADK</span> doesn&#8217;t support <span class="caps">XML</span>
        validation out of the box, but it does do validation that the <span class="caps">XML</span>
        at least matches its internal metadata. You can choose 'Yes' or 'No' here.</p>
    <h3>
        Error Handling</h3>
    <p>
        -If a <span class="caps">SIF</span>_Ack is returned with any type of error category
        other than a transport error, does the application stop trying to send the message
        (delete or inactivate the message) in order to avoid a potential deadlock condition?-</p>
    <p>
        Yes</p>
    <h3>
        Buffer Size</h3>
    <p>
        -Minimum <span class="caps">SIF</span>_MaxBufferSize (in bytes):- Suggested: 4096</p>
    <p>
        -Maximum <span class="caps">SIF</span>_MaxBufferSize (in bytes):- Suggested: 1048576</p>
    <h3>
        Unicode Support</h3>
    <p>
        -Does your agent support Unicode (e.g. it does not map back and forth between Unicode
        and a local character set)?-</p>
    <p>
        Yes</p>
